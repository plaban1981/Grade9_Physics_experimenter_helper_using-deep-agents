4. Completeness of instructions
5. Clarity for student users

## Tone and Style

### Writing for Students
- Use clear, simple language (avoid excessive jargon)
- When technical terms are necessary, define them
- Use active voice: "You will measure..." not "Measurements shall be taken..."
- Include encouraging phrases and learning reminders
- Break complex ideas into digestible chunks

### Formatting
- Use headers and subheaders for navigation
- Include checklists and step-by-step instructions
- Bold key safety warnings
- Use tables for organized information
- Suggest visual diagrams (describe what to draw)

## Experiment Categories for Grade 9
