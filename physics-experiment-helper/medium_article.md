# Building an AI-Powered Physics Experiment Helper with LangChain's DeepAgents: A Complete Implementation Guide

*How we built a sophisticated educational AI system that generates comprehensive Grade 9 physics experiment guides using advanced agent orchestration*

---

## Introduction

In the rapidly evolving landscape of AI agents, most implementations remain "shallow" — they can perform simple tool-calling tasks but struggle with complex, multi-step workflows that require planning, state management, and specialized expertise. This limitation becomes particularly apparent when building educational applications that need to generate comprehensive, accurate, and pedagogically sound content.

Enter **LangChain's DeepAgents library** — a powerful framework that enables developers to create "deep" agents capable of sophisticated reasoning, planning, and execution of complex tasks. In this article, we'll explore how we built a complete **Physics Experiment Helper** that generates comprehensive Grade 9 physics experiment guides using DeepAgents, demonstrating the library's core concepts through a real-world implementation.

## The Challenge: Building an Educational AI System

Our goal was to create an AI system that could:

1. **Generate complete physics experiment guides** for Grade 9 students
2. **Research current educational resources** and safety guidelines
3. **Create multiple interconnected files** (theory, methodology, data templates, etc.)
4. **Generate custom images** using AI for visual learning
5. **Ensure age-appropriate content** with proper safety considerations
6. **Provide real-time updates** during generation
7. **Handle complex multi-step workflows** without getting stuck in loops

Traditional LLM agents would struggle with this complexity, often producing incomplete or inconsistent results. DeepAgents provided the perfect solution.

## Understanding DeepAgents: The Four Pillars

Based on the [MarkTechPost article](https://www.marktechpost.com/2025/10/20/meet-langchains-deepagents-library-and-a-practical-example-to-see-how-deepagents-actually-work-in-action/), DeepAgents architecture is built on four key pillars:

### 1. **Planning Tool** (`write_todos`)
Allows agents to break down complex tasks into manageable steps and track progress over time.

### 2. **Sub-Agents**
Enables the main agent to delegate specialized tasks to focused, expert sub-agents.

### 3. **File System Access**
Provides persistent memory through file operations (`write_file`, `read_file`, `edit_file`, `ls`).

### 4. **Detailed System Prompts**
Gives agents clear instructions, context, and constraints for long-term objectives.

## Implementation Deep Dive

### 1. Core Agent Setup

Our main physics experiment agent is built using DeepAgents' core functionality:

```python
from deepagents import create_deep_agent
from deepagents.sub_agent import SubAgent
from langchain_core.tools import tool

def create_physics_experiment_agent(model_name: str = "gpt-4o"):
    """Create a physics experiment helper agent."""
    agent = create_deep_agent(
        tools=[internet_search],
        instructions=PHYSICS_EXPERIMENT_SYSTEM_PROMPT,
        subagents=[research_sub_agent, critique_sub_agent],
        model=model_name,
    ).with_config({"recursion_limit": 50})
    
    return agent
```

### 2. Advanced Web Search Implementation

One of the key challenges was implementing robust web search functionality. We created a multi-tier search system:

```python
@tool
def internet_search(query: str, max_results: int = 5, search_engine: str = "google") -> str:
    """Run a web search for physics education resources."""
    try:
        # Try SerpAPI first (most reliable)
        serpapi_key = os.getenv("SERPAPI_API_KEY")
        if serpapi_key:
            return _search_with_serpapi(query, max_results, serpapi_key)
        
        # Fallback to DuckDuckGo (free, no API key needed)
        return _search_with_duckduckgo(query, max_results)
        
    except Exception as e:
        # Graceful degradation
        return f"Search temporarily unavailable. Query: '{query}'. Please proceed with general knowledge."
```

**Why this approach works:**
- **Primary**: SerpAPI for comprehensive, structured results
- **Fallback**: DuckDuckGo for free, reliable search
- **Graceful degradation**: Prevents agent loops when search fails

### 3. AI-Powered Image Generation

A standout feature of our system is the integration of AI image generation using Replicate's nano-banana model:

```python
@tool
def generate_experiment_image(
    experiment_topic: str,
    style: str = "scientific",
    custom_prompt: str = None
) -> str:
    """Generate an image for a physics experiment using AI."""
    if not IMAGE_GENERATION_AVAILABLE:
        return "Image generation is not available."
    
    try:
        result = image_service.generate_experiment_image(
            experiment_topic=experiment_topic,
            prompt=custom_prompt,
            style=style
        )
        
        if result["status"] == "success":
            return f"Successfully generated image: {result['url']}"
        else:
            return f"Failed to generate image: {result.get('error')}"
            
    except Exception as e:
        return f"Error generating image: {str(e)}"
```

**Key Features:**
- **Multiple Styles**: Scientific (professional), Educational (student-friendly), Diagram (technical)
- **Custom Prompts**: Agents can generate context-specific images
- **Local Storage**: Images are downloaded and saved locally
- **Export Integration**: Generated images are included in ZIP downloads
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks when generation fails

### 4. Specialized Sub-Agents

Our system uses two specialized sub-agents, each with distinct expertise:

#### Research Sub-Agent
```python
research_sub_agent = SubAgent(
    name="research-agent",
    description="Expert educational researcher specializing in physics and Grade 9 science curriculum.",
    prompt=RESEARCH_AGENT_PROMPT,
)
```

**Responsibilities:**
- Research physics concepts and experiment procedures
- Find safety guidelines and educational resources
- Gather current information on physics education

#### Critique Sub-Agent
```python
critique_sub_agent = SubAgent(
    name="critique-agent", 
    description="Experienced physics teacher reviewing experiment guides for Grade 9 students.",
    prompt=CRITIQUE_AGENT_PROMPT,
)
```

**Responsibilities:**
- Review generated content for safety and accuracy
- Ensure age-appropriateness for Grade 9 students
- Validate scientific accuracy and completeness

### 5. Comprehensive System Prompt

The system prompt is crucial for guiding the agent's behavior. Our prompt includes:

```python
PHYSICS_EXPERIMENT_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """
You are an expert Grade 9 physics teacher and science fair mentor...

## Primary Workflow
1. **Initialize**: Record the experiment request in `experiment_request.txt`
2. **Research**: Use the research-agent to gather scientific background
3. **Design**: Create comprehensive experiment documentation
4. **Review**: Use critique-agent to ensure educational quality and safety
5. **Finalize**: Produce polished, student-friendly deliverables

## Output Structure
You will create a comprehensive experiment package consisting of:
- experiment_synopsis.md
- theory_and_background.md  
- methodology.md
- data_template.md
- analysis_and_conclusion.md
- report_template.md
- references_and_resources.md
"""
```

### 6. Real-Time Updates via WebSocket

The system provides real-time updates during generation:

```python
@app.websocket("/ws/generate-experiment")
async def websocket_generate_experiment(websocket: WebSocket):
    """WebSocket endpoint for streaming experiment generation."""
    await websocket.accept()
    
    try:
        # Send status updates
        await websocket.send_json({
            "type": "status",
            "message": "Starting experiment generation...",
            "session_id": session_id
        })
        
        # Run agent with real-time updates
        result = await asyncio.to_thread(run_physics_agent, experiment_description, model_name)
        
        # Send file updates as they're generated
        for filename, content in files.items():
            await websocket.send_json({
                "type": "file_update",
                "filename": filename,
                "content": content,
                "preview": content[:500] + "..." if len(content) > 500 else content
            })
```

## Key Technical Challenges and Solutions

### 1. **Recursion Limit Management**

**Problem**: Agents getting stuck in infinite loops when search fails.

**Solution**: 
- Increased recursion limit to 50
- Implemented graceful error handling in search functions
- Added fallback responses to prevent loops

### 2. **Web Search API Reliability**

**Problem**: Single search API dependency causing failures.

**Solution**: Multi-tier search system:
- Primary: SerpAPI (most reliable)
- Secondary: DuckDuckGo (free, no API key)
- Fallback: Graceful degradation with mock responses

### 3. **Sub-Agent Integration**

**Problem**: Sub-agents not properly integrated with main agent.

**Solution**: Used proper `SubAgent` TypedDict structure:
```python
research_sub_agent = SubAgent(
    name="research-agent",
    description="...",
    prompt=RESEARCH_AGENT_PROMPT,
)
```

### 4. **File System Management**

**Problem**: Managing multiple interconnected files.

**Solution**: Leveraged DeepAgents' built-in file tools:
- `write_file` for creating new files
- `edit_file` for updating existing files
- `read_file` for accessing previous work
- `ls` for file management
